Resources:
1. In the drowsiness detection model, I utilized the 'shape predictor 68 face landmarks.dat' file. Unfortunately, I am unable to upload the file directly. You can download it from Kaggle using the following link: [shape predictor 68 face landmarks.dat](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sajikim/shape-predictor-68-face-landmarks)

2. For the wrinkle detection task, I utilized the [UTKFace dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new). This dataset contains a diverse set of facial images with associated age, gender, and ethnicity labels. It was instrumental in training and evaluating the wrinkle detection model.

3. For the speech emotion detection task, I used the [TESS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess). The TESS dataset comprises emotional speech recordings spoken by different actors. It played a crucial role in training and evaluating the speech-related components of the project.

4. For the Emotion Detection task, I used the [FER-2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).
